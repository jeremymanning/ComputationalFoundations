Ashar et al. 2022, JAMA Psychiatry
This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of patients with chronic back pain (>= 4/10 pain for at least 3 months, average duration ~10 years). The trial compares Pain Reprocessing Therapy, Placebo (a single injection into the skin of the back), and Usual Care treatments, with pre-treatment and post-treatment (1 month after treatment initiation), and follow-up to 1 year.

Here's what the improvement looks like for the 3 groups:

Let's recreate a GLM from scratch and do an analysis of this dataset.
The goal: Assess whether pain changes with Pain Reprocessing Therapy treatment and/or placebo treatment relative to usual care.

The walkthrough below loads the dataset in Matlab and creates a simple version of the dataset we'll work with:
**NOTE**:  You will need CANlab Core Tools (canlab.gitub.io) on your Matlab path to recreate the plots.

## Activity:

Use your hand-coded GLM to analyze differences in back pain (BPI) improvement by group.
- Include tests of contrasts for PRT - Placebo, and Placebo - Control.

**Analysis 1: Custom GLM**
Steps:
Code the core GLM equations
Create a design matrix(X) that codes for differences among the 3 groups
Estimate the model and report output
Validate by comparing with an established GLM function
Turn your code into a function that you can run on any inputs X, y, and regressor names

**Analysis 2: Scaling**
Explore the relationship between beta-hats and group means
What is the relationship between beta-hats in your model and group means for the 3 groups?
Why?

**Analysis 3: Contrasts**
So far, we have coded the group comparisons into the design matrix. But we can also apply contrasts after parameter estimation to test the group differences of interest.
- Extend your GLM function to include contrasts for group means
- Run the GLM with the indicator matrix for groups as X, passing in the contrast matrix C
- Compare the output to our previous group difference-coded design matrix

We have fit a model without an intercept. Is this OK? Why or why not?
