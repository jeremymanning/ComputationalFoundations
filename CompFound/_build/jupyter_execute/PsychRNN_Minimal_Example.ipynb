The RDM task is a forced choice task -- although dots can move in any direction, their are two directions in which the movement of the coherent dots could be. The subject must make a choice towards one of the two directions at the end of the stimulus period ([Britten et al., 1992](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/12/12/4745)).\n",

We've included this example task in PsychRNN as [PerceptualDiscrimination](../apidoc/tasks.rst#module-psychrnn.tasks.perceptual_discrimination).\n",
