# Mixed effects algebra

## Starter simulations

We'll take a simulation-based approach to understanding mixed effects and how they perform.
We'll address questions including:
- Is the 2-stage summary statistics approach valid?  
- Is is as powerful as a full mixed effects model?
- What is the power and false positive rate of different approaches and implementations?
- What happens when we violate some of the assumptions?

First, we'll generate some data under a simple mixed effects scenario (a simple generative model) and explore some plots of the data. We'll fit the model using several mixed effects models:
- Matlab's fitlme
- CANlab's glmfit_multilevel
- CANlab's igls and rigls

The live script below also reviews the main elements of the matrix algebra underlying mixed effects, using the notation in [Lindquist et al. 2012](papers/Lindquist_2012_variance components_in_multi-level_GLM.pdf). The model describes the basic framework and Iterative Generalized Least Squares, one way of estimating variance components.  Other models have a similar structure but differ in some details (e.g., [Bates et al. 2015](papers/lme4_Bates_2015.pdf) for LMER in R).

## Activities

1. Identify and compare residual variance terms, slope estimates, t-values across models
2. Modify the code to generate one or more continuous predictors instead of categorical/experimental ones.
3. Turn the data-generation script into a function, so that you can efficiently simulate power and false positive rates using repeated simulations -- two key properties of any statistical model.
